# Welcome to cameraMode.io!

cameraMode is a production budgeting tool for media company on-set professionals. You can use this tools to aggregate product information for camera packages and save options for future lookup and comparison. I am currently working on integrating an AI comparison feature that leverages OpenAI for product research.
