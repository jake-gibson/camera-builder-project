# Welcome to cameraMode.io!

<b><i>cameraMode.io</i></b> is a production budgeting tool for media company on-set professionals. You can use this tool to aggregate product information for camera packages, saving options for future lookup and comparison. I am currently working on integrating an AI comparison feature that leverages OpenAI for product research.
